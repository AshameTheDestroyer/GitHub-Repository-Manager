# GitHub-Repository-Manager

The proejct is all about fetching data about a specified user on GitHub, and returns all basic information about them, including every public repository they ever published on here, with all the basic information about each repository as well, such as languages used, and watcher count.

This project is my very first project to use REST API 👩🏻‍💻, and it's actually one of the best things I've ever learnt so far 🔥.

I also uploaded this project on my 20th birthday 🎂🍰 :).
